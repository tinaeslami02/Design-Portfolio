# Spuddy — Social Sports Matching (Prototype)

Discover local racket sports (padel, tennis, ping pong, squash, badminton). Get matched by skill and availability, with courts, payments, and chat all handled for you. Built as a fast, scrappy prototype to validate an “all-in-one match + logistics” experience.

- 🎯 **Core**: auto-match by level/time/location, RSVP + pay, see who’s going, group chat, photo share
- 🔁 **Auto-Match**: Tinder-like “accept/decline” offers, improves suggestions over time
- 🧠 **Fair Play**: score verification by both sides; attendance tracking + no-show compensation
- 🌦️ **Smart**: weather warnings for outdoor bookings

**Live artifacts**
