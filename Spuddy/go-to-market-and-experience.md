# Go-to-Market & Product Experience

## UX Flows (Core Loop)

1. **Onboarding**  
   - User sets level (seeded from quick Q&A) and preferences (time, location, budget).  

2. **Auto-Match Offer**  
   - App proposes a complete match (players, time, court, cost).  
   - User can accept/decline within a timer.  

3. **Checkout & RSVP**  
   - Seamless payment (Stripe or local methods).  
   - Confirmed roster shows attendees + levels.  

4. **Engagement**  
   - In-app chat for coordination.  
   - Share photos.  
   - Weather updates for outdoor courts.  

5. **Post-Match**  
   - Score verification (both players confirm).  
   - Progression points + optional leaderboard.  
   - Quick feedback (“Would you play again?”).

## Monetization (Integrated with Flows)

- **Transaction Fee (Flow 3)**  
  Small % per booking/RSVP → baseline revenue.  

- **Premium Matching (Flow 2)**  
  Priority match offers, advanced filters, preferred time slots.  

- **Leagues & Tournaments (Flow 5)**  
  Paid entry for seasonal competitions.  

- **Coaching & Training (Flow 1 + Flow 5)**  
  Upsell coaching during onboarding or after match feedback.

## Marketing Hooks (Tied to Experience)

- **Referral Credits (Flow 2)**  
  Share an auto-match with a friend → both earn credits.  

- **Venue Partnerships (Flow 3)**  
  Discounted bookings, featured courts promoted in-app.  

- **Community Challenges (Flow 5)**  
  Weekly leaderboards, group milestones, or “streak” rewards.  

- **Social Media Integration (Flow 4)**  
  Easy sharing of match highlights, photos, and achievements.

## Why This Works

- **Flows drive adoption** → clear, repeatable user journey.  
- **Monetization is natural** → built into key decision points, not bolted on.  
- **Marketing grows organically** → users promote while engaging (referrals, social sharing, venue partnerships).
