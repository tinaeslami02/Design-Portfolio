# Spuddy — Social Sports Matching

## Problem
- Hard to find partners at the **right skill level**
- **Coordination tax**: time, venue, weather, equipment
- Motivation fades without goals → need **gamified progression**

## Solution
A sports companion that:
1) **Matches** players by level + availability + location  
2) **Handles logistics** (suggests/book courts, weather-aware)  
3) Adds **light progression** (points/levels), optional leagues

## Target Users
- Adults who play racket sports casually → regularly
- Not club-committed, want reliable partners and convenient slots

## Key Features (MVP)
- **Onboarding + skill seed** (few questions → starting level)
- **Auto-match offers** (accept/decline within time window)
- **See who’s going** + attendee levels
- **Pay + RSVP** (multiple methods), **chat**, **add photos**
- **Score verification** (both parties confirm)
- **Weather warnings** for outdoor bookings

## Differentiators / USP
- **App books courts** (partnerships/APIs) — reduces planning effort
- **Continuous match suggestions** (learns from user choices)
- **Fairness layer** (attendance + no-show compensation)
- **Multi-sport ready**, starts with racket sports

## Early Flow (Figma)
1) Sign up / login → set prefs (times, areas, level)  
2) Auto-match proposal → all-in-one detail (time, place, cost)  
3) Accept → pay → see roster & levels → chat → play → verify score

## Evidence / Competitors (summary)
- **Playtomic**: strong booking, light matching → manual effort
- **RacketPal / Spin**: matching & leagues but **logistics on users**
- **Gap**: proactive **auto-match + court booking + verification**

## Risks & Assumptions
- Venue integrations (availability/booking APIs) are feasible
- Enough density per area/time for match liquidity
- Users accept **semi-automated** match proposals

## What to test first (prototype goals)
- CTR on **auto-match offers**
- **Accept rate** to confirmed match
- **Show-up rate** and **score verification completion**
- “Would you play again?” after first match
